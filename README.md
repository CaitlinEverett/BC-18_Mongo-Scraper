# I am not Cambridge Analytica, but I know basically how that whole thing worked...  

  1. Whenever a user visits the site, the app scrapes stories from the onion and displays them for the user. Each scraped article is saved to the app database. The app scrapes and displays the following information for each article:

     * Headline - the title of the article

     * Summary - a short summary of the article

     * URL - the url to the original article

     * Feel free to add more content to your database (photos, bylines, and so on).

  2. Users are able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments are saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. Users are also able to delete comments left on articles. All stored comments are visible to every user.
